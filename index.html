            <p>
                Brace yourselves, what follows is an amazingly long blog post about the best order in which to watch
                Star Wars.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, let me say this: for people that couldn't care less about the prequel trilogy, I suggest Harmy's
                Despecialized Editions. They are 720p videos that are the result of "Harmy" from The Original Trilogy
                forums painstakingly reconstructing the theatrical releases of all three films utilizing a wide variety
                of video sources as well as custom mattes. Downloading, burning, labeling, and printing cases for these
                films is one of the neckbeardiest things I've done (aside from writing this blog post), and I'm
                extremely glad I did it. If the "proper order" for Star Wars for you is the original trilogy and nothing
                else, stop reading now and find the Despecialized Editions.
            </p>
            <div class="off-flow-block">
                <img src="assets/img/img1.jpg" alt="Blue-ray star wars collection">
                <span>Harmy, King of the Nerds!</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                So, with that out of the way, what can you do if you do wish to involve the prequel trilogy? Maybe you
                don't want to mess around with fan edits or the pirate bay, and you just want to watch the official
                Blu-rays with your kids. Maybe you've accepted that the original theatrical editions are no longer
                considered canon, and you're a nerd that cares about things like that. Hell, maybe you actually like the
                prequels (seriously?).
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever your reason, if you are showing someone the official editions of Star Wars for the first time,
                you have to make a decision about which order to watch the films.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="release-vs-episode">
            <h2>Release Order vs Episode Order</h2>
            <p>There are two obvious options for watching the Star Wars saga.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Release Order</b>- Watch the films in the order they came out, recreating your experience with
                    the films for someone new to them.
                </li>
                <li><b>Episode Order</b>- Watch the films in the order George Lucas intends, starting with Episode I and
                    going straight through to Episode VI
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are two critical flaws with both of these orders, unfortunately, that prevent either from being
                appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The problem with Episode Order is that it ruins one of the biggest twists in movie history.</b>
                If you think that this reveal doesn't matter since it's common knowledge, I suggest you watch the looks
                on these kids' faces. If a newcomer to the series has managed to avoid having it spoiled for them,
                watching the films in Episode Order would be like watching the ending of The Sixth Sense first.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other problem with Episode Order is that the prequels don't really have a story. They're just
                background for the real story, which is Luke and his new friends trying to defeat the Empire. Watching 3
                films of backstory is boring if you've never seen the films they're the background to. Hell, that's why
                George Lucas made Star Wars (later renamed A New Hope) first - it was the most interesting story he had
                in his brain at the time. Starting someone off with Episode I is a surefire way to ensure they don't
                make it through the entire franchise.
            </p>
            <div>
                <div class="off-flow-block off-flow-block__right">
                    <img src="assets/img/jedi_ruined.jpg" alt="New actors for new jedi">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Release Order is also an instant failure, and the reason is a single shot. If you're
                    watching the official releases and you view the original trilogy first, then at the end of Episode
                    6, Luke looks over at his mentors, Ben Kenobi and Yoda, and suddenly they are joined by... some
                    random creepy looking teenager who needs a haircut. Placing Hayden Christensen in the ending of
                    Jedi, since he's not in ANY of the other films, turns an ending that should be celebratory into one
                    that is confusing for the viewer. The fact that Christensen looks like he's undressing someone with
                    his eyes doesn't help.
                </p>
                <p>So neither order really works. What to do?</p>
